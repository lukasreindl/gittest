Physio Calender

Basic Idea:

This kind of calender should count the treatment sessions of a patient. 
normaly there are six or ten treaments planned for one perscription. 
after the sixth or tenth session there should be a reminder that the treatment is over.
there should be a new perscrption and a reminder for a report for the referral doctors.
